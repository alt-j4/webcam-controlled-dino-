# webcam-controlled-dino-
This project is a Python-based Dino Runner game that uses real-time webcam motion detection for hands-free controls. Built with Pygame, OpenCV, and NumPy, the game detects upward hand movement to trigger jumps. It explores integrating computer vision with game mechanics through an interactive prototype.
